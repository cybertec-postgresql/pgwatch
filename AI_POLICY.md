# ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE & AUTOMATION POLICY (V1.0)

**Last Updated:** February 26, 2026

Participation in this project, including all interactions with its repositories (Issues, Pull Requests, Discussions, Reviews, and Comments) and community spaces (Mailing lists, Slack, Discord), is strictly subject to the following conditions:

## 1. ASSUMPTION OF AGENCY AND RESPONSIBILITY

The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Large Language Models (LLM), or any automated generative technology does not diminish the user's personal liability or agency. All interactions, contributions, and communications are attributed solely to the human actor. The project maintainers will treat every interaction as a conscious, deliberate act performed with full understanding of its content and consequences.

## 2. MANDATORY ATTRIBUTION

Any interaction that is modified, generated, or assisted—in whole or in part—by automated tools must be explicitly disclosed within the same interaction. This includes, but is not limited to:

- AI Assistants and Chatbots (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini).

- AI-integrated IDEs and Code Generation Tools (e.g., GitHub Copilot, Cursor).

**Disclosure Format:** Every such interaction must include the specific name and version of the tool(s) used (e.g., _"Drafted with the assistance of GPT-4o"_ or _"Spell-checked via Grammarly v1.2"_).

## 3. ENFORCEMENT AND TERMINATION

Adherence to this policy is a prerequisite for participating in this community. Failure to provide accurate attribution, or any attempt to obfuscate the use of automated tools, shall result in the immediate and permanent termination of the user’s access to the project repositories and community channels, including an unconditional ban from future participation.

_THIS POLICY IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND THE PROJECT MAINTAINERS RESERVE THE RIGHT TO UPDATE THESE TERMS AT ANY TIME._
