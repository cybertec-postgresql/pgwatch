Components
==========

The main development idea around pgwatch3 was to do the minimal work needed and not to reinvent the wheel - meaning that
pgwatch3 is mostly just about gluing together already some proven pieces of software for metrics storage and using Grafana
for dashboarding. So here a listing of components that can be used to build up a monitoring setup around the pgwatch3
metrics collector. Note that most components are not mandatory and for tasks like metrics storage there are many components
to choose from.

The metrics gathering daemon
----------------------------

The metrics collector, written in Go, is the only mandatory and most critical component of the whole solution. The main
task of the pgwatch3 collector / daemon is pretty simple - reading the configuration and metric defintions, fetching the metrics
from the configured databases using the configured connection info and finally storing the metrics to some other
database, or just exposing them over a port for scraping in case of Prometheus mode.

Configuration store
-------------------

The configuration says which databases, how often and with which metrics (SQL-s queries) are to be gathered.
There are 3 options to store the configuration:

  - A PostgreSQL database holding a simple schema with 5 tables.

  - File based approach - YAML config file(s) and SQL metric definition files.

Metrics storage DB
------------------

Many options here so that one can for example go for maximum storage effectiveness or pick something where they already
know the query language:

  - `PostgreSQL <https://www.postgresql.org/>`_ - world's most advanced Open Source RDBMS

    Postgres storage is based on the JSONB datatype so minimally version 9.4+ is required, but for bigger setups where
    partitioning is a must, v11+ is needed. Any already existing Postgres database will do the trick, see the :ref:`Bootstrapping the Metrics DB <metrics_db_bootstrap>` section for2 details.

  - `TimescaleDB <https://www.timescale.com/>`_ time-series extension for PostgreSQL

    Although technically a plain extension it's often mentioned as a separate database system as it brings custom data compression
    to the table, enabling huge disk savings over standard Postgres. Note that pgwatch3 does not use Timescale's built-in *retention*
    management but a custom version.

  - `Prometheus <https://prometheus.io/>`_ Time Series DB and monitoring system

    Though Prometheus is not a traditional database system, it's a good choice for monitoring Cloud-like environments as the
    monitoring targets don't need to know too much about how actual monitoring will be carried out later and also Prometheus
    has a nice fault-tolerant alerting system for enterprise needs. By default Prometheus is not set up for long term
    metrics storage!

  - `Graphite <https://graphiteapp.org/>`_ Time Series DB

    Not as modern as the other options but a performant TSDB nevertheless with built-in charting. In pgwatch3 use case though
    there's no support for "custom tags" and request batching support which should not be a big problem for lighter use cases.

  - JSON files

    Plain text files for testing / special use cases.

The Web UI
----------

The second homebrewn component of the pgwatch3 solution is an optional and relatively simple Web UI for administering details
of the monitoring configuration like which databases should be monitored, with which metrics and intervals. Besides that there
are some basic overview tables to analyze the gathered data and also possibilities to delete unneeded metric data (when removing
a test host for example).

Note that the Web UI can only be used if storing the configuration in the database (Postgres).

Metrics representation
----------------------

Standard pgwatch3 setup uses `Grafana <http://grafana.org/>`_ for analyzing the gathered metrics data in a visual, point-and-click
way. For that a rich set of predefined dashboards for Postgres is provided, that should cover
the needs of most users - advanced users would mostly always want to customize some aspects though, so it's not meant as
a one-size-fits-all solution. Also as metrics are stored in a DB, they can be visualized or processed in any other way.

.. _component_reuse:

Component reuse
---------------

All components are *loosely coupled*, thus for non-pgwatch3 components (pgwatch3 components are only the metrics collector
and the optional Web UI) you can decide to make use of an already existing installation of Postgres, Grafana or Prometheus
and run additionally just the pgwatch3 collector.

* To use an existing Postgres DB for storing the monitoring config

  Create a new pgwatch3 DB, preferrably also an accroding role who owns it. Then roll out the schema (pgwatch3/sql/config_store/config_store.sql)
  and set the following parameters when running the image: PW3_PGHOST, PW3_PGPORT, PW3_PGDATABASE, PW3_PGUSER, PW3_PGPASSWORD, PW3_PGSSL (optional).

* To use an existing Grafana installation

  Load the pgwatch3 dashboards from *grafana_dashboard* folder if needed (one can totally define their own) and set the following paramater: PW3_GRAFANA_BASEURL.
  This parameter only provides correct links to Grafana dashboards from the Web UI. Grafana is the most loosely coupled component for pgwatch3
  and basically doesn't have to be used at all. One can make use of the gathered metrics directly over the Postgres (or Graphite) API-s.

* To use an existing Graphite installation

  One can also store the metrics in Graphite instead of Postgres (no predefined pgwatch3 dashboards for Graphite though).
  Following parameters needs to be set then: PW3_DATASTORE=graphite, PW3_GRAPHITEHOST, PW3_GRAPHITEPORT

* To use an existing Postgres DB for storing metrics

  1. Roll out the metrics storage schema according to instructions from :ref:`here <metrics_db_bootstrap>`.
  2. Following parameters need to be set for the gatherer:

    * ``--datastore=postgres`` or ``PW3_DATASTORE=postgres``
    * ``--pg-metric-store-conn-str="postgresql://user:pwd@host:port/db"`` or ``PW3_PG_METRIC_STORE_CONN_STR="..."``
    * optionally also adjust the ``--pg-retention-days`` parameter. By default 14 days for Postgres are kept

  3. If using the Web UI also set the datastore parameters ``--datastore`` and ``--pg-metric-store-conn-str`` if wanting to
     have an option to be able to clean up data also via the UI in a more targeted way.

  When using Postgres metrics storage, the schema rollout script activates "asynchronous commiting" feature for the
  *pgwatch3* role in the metrics storage DB by default! If this is not wanted (no metrics can be lost in case of a crash),
  then re-enstate normal (synchronous) commiting with below query and restart the pgwatch3 agent:

  ::

    ALTER ROLE pgwatch3 IN DATABASE $MY_METRICS_DB SET synchronous_commit TO on;
