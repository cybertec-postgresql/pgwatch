title: Project background
---

The pgwatch project got started back in 2016 and released in 2017
initially for internal monitoring needs at Cybertec as all the Open
Source PostgreSQL monitoring tools at the time had various limitations
like being too slow and invasive to set up or providing a fixed set of
visuals and metrics.

For more background on the project motivations and design goals see the
original series of blogposts announcing the project and the following
feature updates released approximately twice per year.

Cybertec also provides commercial 9-to-5 and 24/7 support for pgwatch.
