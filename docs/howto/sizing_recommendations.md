title: Sizing recommendations

-   Min 1GB of RAM is required for a Docker setup using Postgres to
    store metrics.

    The gatherer alone needs typically less than 50 MB if the metric 
    measurements are stored online. Memory consumption will increase a lot when the
    metrics store is offline though, as then metrics are cached in RAM
    in ring buffer style up to a limit of 10k data points (for all
    databases) and then memory consumption is dependent on how "wide"
    are the metrics gathered.

-   Storage requirements vary a lot and are hard to predict.

    10GB of disk space should be enough though for monitoring a single
    DB with "exhaustive" *preset* for 1 month with Postgres storage. 2
    weeks is also the default metrics retention policy for Postgres
    running in Docker (configurable). Depending on the amount of schema
    objects - tables, indexes, stored procedures and especially on
    number of unique SQLs, it could be also much more. If disk size
    reduction is wanted for PostgreSQL storage then best would be to use
    the TimescaleDB extension - it has built-in compression and disk
    footprint is x5 time less than vanilla Postgres, while retaining full
    SQL support.

-   A low-spec (1 vCPU, 2 GB RAM) cloud machine can easily monitor 100
    DBs in "exhaustive" settings (i.e. almost all metrics are
    monitored in 1-2min intervals) without breaking a sweat (\<20%
    load).

-   A single Postgres node should handle thousands of requests per
    second.

-   When high metrics write latency is problematic (e.g. using a DBaaS
    across the Atlantic) then increasing the default maximum batching
    delay of 250ms usually gives good results.
    Relevant params: `--batching-delay-ms / PW_BATCHING_MAX_DELAY_MS`.

-   Note that when monitoring a very large number of databases, it's
    possible to "shard" / distribute them between many metric
    collection instances running on different hosts, via the `group`
    attribute. This requires that some hosts have been assigned a
    non-default *group* identifier, which is just a text field exactly
    for this sharding purpose.
    Relevant params: `--group / PW_GROUP`.
