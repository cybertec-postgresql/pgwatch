Long term installations
=======================

For long term pgwatch3 setups the main challenge is to keep the software up-to-date to guarantee stable operation and also
to make sure that all DB-s are under monitoring.

Keeping inventory in sync
-------------------------

Adding new DBs to monitoring and removing those shut down, can become a problem if teams are big, databases are many, and
it's done per hand (common for on-premise, non-orchestrated deployments). To combat that, the most typical approach would
be to write some script or Cronjob that parses the company's internal inventory database, files or endpoints and translate changes
to according CRUD operations on the *pgwatch3.monitored_db* table directly.

One could also use the Web UI page (pseudo) *API* for that purpose, if the optional Web UI component has been deployed.
See `here <https://github.com/cybertec-postgresql/pgwatch3/blob/master/docker/test/smoke_test_docker_image.sh#L44>`__
for an usage example - but direct database access is of course more flexible.

If pgwatch3 configuration is kept in YAML files, it should be also relatively easy to automate the maintenance as the
configuration can be organized so that one file represent a single monitoring entry, i.e. the *\-\-config* parameter can
also refer to a folder of YAML files.

Updating the pgwatch3 collector
-------------------------------

The pgwatch3 metrics gathering daemon is the core component of the solution alas the most critical one. So it's definitely recommended
to update it at least once per year or minimally when some freshly released Postgres major version instances are added to monitoring.
New Postgres versions don't necessary mean that something will break, but you'll be missing some newly added metrics, plus
the occasional optimizations. See the ref:`upgrading chapter <upgrading>` for details, but basically the process is very
similar to initial installation as the collector doesn't have any state on its own - it's just on binary program.

Metrics maintenance
-------------------

Metric definition SQL-s are regularly corrected as suggestions / improvements come in and also new ones are added to cover
latest Postgres versions, so would make sense to refresh them 1-2x per year.

If using a YAML based config, just installing newer pre-built RPM / DEB packages will do the trick automatically (built-in
metrics at */etc/pgwatch3/metrics* will be refreshed) but for Config DB based setups you'd need to follow a simple process
described :ref:`here <updating_metrics>`.

Dashboard maintenance
---------------------

Same as with metrics, also the built-in Grafana dashboards are being actively updates, so would make sense to refresh them
occasionally also. The bulk delete / import scripts can be found `here <https://github.com/cybertec-postgresql/pgwatch3/tree/master/grafana_dashboards>`__
or you could also manually just re-import some dashboards of interest from JSON files in `/etc/pgwatch3/grafana-dashboards` folder
or from `Github <https://github.com/cybertec-postgresql/pgwatch3/tree/master/grafana_dashboards>`__.

NB! The *delete_all_old_pw2_dashes.sh* script deletes all pgwatch3 built-in dashboards so you should take
some extra care when you've changed them. In general it's a good idea not to modify the preset dashboards too much, but
rate use the "Save As..." button and rename the dashboards to something else.

FYI - notable new dashboards are usually listed also in `release notes <https://github.com/cybertec-postgresql/pgwatch3/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md>`__
and most dashboards also have a sample `screenshots <https://github.com/cybertec-postgresql/pgwatch3/tree/master/screenshots>`__ available.

Storage monitoring
------------------

In addition to all that you should at least initially periodically monitor the metrics DB size...as it can grow quite a
lot (especially when using Postgres for storage) when the monitored databases have hundreds of tables / indexes and if a
lot of unique SQL-s are used and *pg_stat_statements* monitoring is enabled. If the storage grows too fast, one can increase
the metric intervals (especially for "table_stats", "index_stats" and "stat_statements") or decrease the data retention
periods via *\-\-pg-retention-days* or *\-\-iretentiondays* params.
