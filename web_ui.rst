The Admin Web UI
================

If using pgwatch3 in the centrally managed *Config DB* way, for easy configuration management (adding databases to monitoring, adding
metrics) there is a small Python Web application bundled making use of the CherryPy
Web-framework.

For mass configuration changes the Web UI has some buttons to disable / enable all hosts for example, but one could
technically also log into the configuration database and change the *pgwatch3.monitored_db* table  directly.

Besides managing the metrics gathering configurations, the two other useful features for the Web UI would be the possibility
to look at the logs of the single components and to verify that metrics gathering is working on the "Stat Statements Overview" page,
which will contact the metrics DB (only Postgres is supported) and present some stats summaries.

Default port: **8080**

Web UI security
---------------

By default the Web UI is not secured - anyone can view and modify the monitoring configuration. If some security is needed
though it can be enabled:

  * HTTPS

    ``--ssl, --ssl-cert, --ssl-key, --ssl-certificate-chain`` or ``PW3_WEBSSL, PW3_WEBCERT, PW3_WEBKEY, PW3_WEBCERTCHAIN``

  * Password protection

    ``--no-anonymous-access, --admin-user, --admin-password`` or ``PW3_WEBNOANONYMOUS, PW3_WEBUSER, PW3_WEBPASSWORD``

  * Hiding some possibly sensitive information

    ``--no-component-logs, --no-stats-summary`` or ``PW3_WEBNOCOMPONENTLOGS, PW3_WEBNOSTATSSUMMARY``

  * Password encryption for the role used for fetching metrics

    ``--aes-gcm-keyphrase, --aes-gcm-keyphrase-file`` or ``PW3_AES_GCM_KEYPHRASE, PW3_AES_GCM_KEYPHRASE_FILE``

    Note that standard *LibPQ .pgpass files* can also be used so there's no requirement to store any passwords in pgwatch3
    config DB. Also note that when enabling password encryption, the same key needs to be presented also for the gatherer.

For security sensitive environments make sure to always deploy password protection together with SSL, as it uses
a standard cookie based techniques vulnerable to snooping / MITM attacks.

Exposing the component logs
---------------------------

When using the Docker images, internal component logs (Postgres, Grafana, Go daemon, Web UI itself) are exposed via the "/logs"
endpoint. If this is not wanted set the PW3_WEBNOCOMPONENTLOGS env. variable. Note that if a working "/logs" endpoint is desired
also in custom setup mode (non-docker) then some actual code changes are needed to specify where logs of all components are
situated - see top of the pgwatch3.py file for that.
